                        utilizing the SteemGigs platform to offer services to Clients). </p>
                    <h6>Information You Provide to Us:</h6>
                    <p>Personal Information: In the course of using the SteemGigs Service (whether as a Client or Freelancer), we may require or otherwise collect information that identifies you as a specific individual and can be used to contact or identify
                        you (“Personal Information”). Example of the Personal Information we would require from you is your STEEMIT.COM USERNAME.</p>
                    General Audience Service: The Service is general audience and intended for users 13 years and older. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone younger than age 13. If we become aware that a child younger than 13 has provided us with

                        a co-marketing agreement or at your request (such as if you choose to sign in with a third-party service). If we combine the information we receive from others with information we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined

                    <p>The technology used to collect information automatically from SteemGigs Users may include the following:
                        <p>Cookies: Like many websites, we and our marketing partners/affiliates/service providers use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes.
                            We use both persistent cookies that remain on your computer or similar device (such as to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service) and session ID cookies, which expire at the end of your browser
                            session (for example, to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how SteemGigs Users interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage by SteemGigs Users and web traffic routing on the Service). You
                            may be able to instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.</p>
                        <p>Work Diaries and Work View: As part of the SteemGigs Service, we collect information about a Freelancer’s work on a project for a Client. This feature is known as Work Diary. Work Diaries include information provided by the Freelancer,
                            such as a memo, as well as automatically gathered information about work on a project. This can be used to display a Freelancer's reputation.</p>

                            may be publicly displayed on the Service. </p>
                        <p>Note that anything you post to a Community Forum through Discord is public — others will have access to your User Forum Content and may use it or share it with third parties. If you choose to voluntarily disclose Personal Information
                            in your User Forum Content or use Community Forums to link your Profile, that information will be considered public information and the protections of this Privacy Policy will not apply.</p>
